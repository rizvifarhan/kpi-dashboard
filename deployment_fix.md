# Quick Deployment Fix

The deployment error was caused by a Python module naming conflict with the `database` module.

## Fix Applied:
1. Renamed `database.py` to `kpi_database.py`
2. Updated import in `app.py` to `from kpi_database import Database`

## Now push this fix:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment error - rename database module"
git push origin main --force
```

This will resolve the KeyError: 'database' import issue and get your app running again.
