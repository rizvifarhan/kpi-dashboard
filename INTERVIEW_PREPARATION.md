# KPI Dashboard - Interview Preparation Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary (30-second elevator pitch)

*"I built a real-time business KPI dashboard using Python and Streamlit that monitors Excel data files, calculates key performance indicators like revenue, profit margins, and growth rates, and sends automated WhatsApp/Slack alerts when metrics fall below predefined thresholds. The system features interactive visualizations, real-time file monitoring, and a modular architecture that can scale from single-user to enterprise deployment."*

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. System Design & Architecture

**Q: Walk me through the overall architecture of your KPI dashboard.**

**A:** The system follows a modular, layered architecture:
- **Frontend Layer**: Streamlit provides the web interface with interactive widgets
- **Business Logic Layer**: Six core modules handle specific responsibilities:
  - DataProcessor: Excel file parsing and data cleaning
  - KPICalculator: Business metrics computation
  - Database: SQLite for data persistence
  - AlertManager: Multi-channel notification system
  - Visualizer: Interactive chart generation
  - FileMonitor: Real-time file change detection
- **Data Layer**: SQLite database with three main tables for KPI data, thresholds, and alert logs
- **External APIs**: WhatsApp Business API and Slack API for notifications

**Q: Why did you choose this modular approach?**

**A:** Separation of concerns makes the code maintainable, testable, and scalable. Each module has a single responsibility, making it easier to modify or extend functionality without affecting other components. This also enables unit testing of individual components.

### 2. Data Processing & Validation

**Q: How do you handle data quality issues in Excel files?**

**A:** I implemented a comprehensive data validation pipeline:
- **Column Standardization**: Convert column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores
- **Data Type Conversion**: Use pandas to_numeric with error handling for numeric columns
- **Missing Value Management**: Drop rows with all NaN values, handle missing dates
- **Format Validation**: Check for required columns (revenue, COGS) with flexible naming
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks when data doesn't meet expected format

```python
def clean_data(self, df):
    df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
    df[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(df[date_col], errors='coerce')
    df = df.dropna(subset=[date_col])
    return df.sort_values(date_col)
```

**Q: What happens if someone uploads an invalid file?**

**A:** The system has multiple validation checkpoints:
1. File type validation (only .xlsx, .xls allowed)
2. Data format validation in DataProcessor
3. Required column checking
4. Error messages displayed to users
5. Graceful fallbacks to prevent crashes

### 3. Real-time Features

**Q: How did you implement real-time file monitoring?**

**A:** I used the Watchdog library to monitor file system changes:
- **Observer Pattern**: FileMonitor sets up a watchdog observer
- **Event Handler**: ExcelFileHandler listens for file modification events
- **Callback System**: When files change, it triggers data reprocessing
- **Thread Safety**: Uses threading to avoid blocking the main application
- **Debouncing**: Checks modification times to avoid duplicate processing

```python
def start_monitoring(self, file_path, callback):
    event_handler = ExcelFileHandler(file_path, callback)
    self.observer = Observer()
    self.observer.schedule(event_handler, path=os.path.dirname(file_path))
    self.observer.start()
```

**Q: How do you handle concurrent file access?**

**A:** The system uses file modification timestamps to detect genuine changes and implements proper error handling for file locking scenarios.

### 4. Database Design & Performance

**Q: Why did you choose SQLite over other databases?**

**A:** SQLite was chosen for several reasons:
- **Simplicity**: No separate server setup required
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Perfect for MVP development
- **Local Storage**: Suitable for single-user applications
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity
- **Embedded**: No additional dependencies

For production scaling, I designed the database layer to be easily replaceable with PostgreSQL.

**Q: How did you design the database schema?**

**A:** Three main tables with normalized design:
```sql
kpi_data: Historical KPI values with timestamps
thresholds: Configurable alert thresholds per KPI
alerts: Log of all sent notifications
```

Each table has proper indexing on frequently queried columns (timestamps, KPI names).

### 5. Visualization & Frontend

**Q: Why did you choose Plotly over other charting libraries?**

**A:** Plotly provides:
- **Interactivity**: Hover effects, zoom, pan capabilities
- **Streamlit Integration**: Native support with st.plotly_chart
- **Chart Variety**: Time series, comparisons, distributions, gauges
- **JSON Serialization**: Efficient data transfer to frontend
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes

**Q: How do you handle large datasets in visualizations?**

**A:** Several optimization strategies:
- **Data Sampling**: For large datasets, sample representative data points
- **Lazy Loading**: Charts only render when tabs are selected
- **Efficient Queries**: Database queries limited to necessary time ranges
- **Memory Management**: Clean up old data periodically

### 6. Error Handling & Reliability

**Q: How did you implement error handling?**

**A:** Multi-layered error handling approach:
- **Input Validation**: At data entry points
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for users
- **Logging**: System errors logged for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning when non-critical components fail

**Q: What was the most challenging bug you fixed?**

**A:** The JSON serialization error in Plotly charts. The issue was that datetime objects and some pandas data types aren't JSON serializable. I fixed it by:
1. Converting datetime objects to strings before chart creation
2. Ensuring all numeric data is properly converted to float/int
3. Adding type checking before serialization
4. Implementing fallback charts for edge cases

### 7. API Integration & External Services

**Q: How did you implement the alert system?**

**A:** Multi-channel alert system with:
- **WhatsApp Business API**: REST API integration for mobile notifications
- **Slack API**: Bot integration for team notifications
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Database-stored threshold values
- **Alert Deduplication**: Prevents spam by checking recent alerts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable

```python
def send_alert(self, message):
    success = False
    if self.whatsapp_token:
        success = self.send_whatsapp_message(message) or success
    if self.slack_token:
        success = self.send_slack_message(message) or success
    return success
```

### 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Q: How did you test the application?**

**A:** Comprehensive testing approach:
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component testing (test_dashboard.py)
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end data flow validation
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Invalid data, missing files, API failures
- **Performance Testing**: Large file handling, concurrent operations
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real-world usage scenarios

**Q: What testing frameworks did you use?**

**A:** Built custom test suite using Python's built-in capabilities, focusing on:
- Data processing accuracy
- KPI calculation verification
- Database operations
- Alert functionality
- Chart generation

### 9. Security & Best Practices

**Q: How do you handle sensitive data like API tokens?**

**A:** Security best practices implemented:
- **Environment Variables**: API tokens stored as environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Password Fields**: Sensitive inputs use password field types
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials externalized
- **Error Message Sanitization**: Avoid exposing internal details

**Q: What security considerations did you implement?**

**A:** 
- File upload validation to prevent malicious files
- Database parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Input sanitization for all user data
- Secure API token handling
